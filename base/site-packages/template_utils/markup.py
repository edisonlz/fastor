    Generic markup formatter which can handle multiple text-to-HTML
    conversion systems.

    
    Overview
    ========
    
    Conversion is handled by filter functions registered with an
    instance; a set of default filters is provided which cover
    Markdown, reStructuredText and Textile (though using one of these
    requires the appropriate module to be available on your system --
    e.g., using the reST filter requires you to have ``docutils``
    installed).
    
    New filters can be added by registering them with an instance;
    simply define a function which performs the conversion you want,
    and use the ``register`` method to add it; ``register`` expects
    two arguments:
    
    1. The name to associate with the filter.
    
    2. The actual filter function.
    
    So, for example, you might define a new filter function called
    ``my_filter``, and register it like so::
    
        formatter = MarkupFormatter()
        formatter.register('my_filter', my_filter)
    
    Instances are callable, so applying the conversion to a string is
    simple::
    
        my_html = formatter(my_string, filter_name='my_filter')
    
    The filter to use for conversion is determined in either of two
    ways:
    
    1. If the keyword argument ``filter_name`` is supplied, it will be
       used as the filter name.
    
    2. Absent an explicit argument, the filter name will be taken from
       the ``MARKUP_FILTER`` setting in your Django settings file (see
       below).
    
    Additionally, arbitrary keyword arguments can be supplied, and
    they will be passed on to the filter function.
    
    
    Reading default bahavior from a Django setting
    ==============================================
    
    The Django setting ``MARKUP_FILTER`` can be used to specify
    default behavior; if used, its value should be a 2-tuple:
    
    * The first element should be the name of a filter.
    
    * The second element should be a dictionary to use as keyword
      arguments for that filter.
    
    So, for example, to have the default behavior apply Markdown with
    safe mode enabled, you would add this to your Django settings
    file::
    
        MARKUP_FILTER = ('markdown', { 'safe_mode': True })
    
    The filter named in this setting does not have to be from the
    default set; as long as you register a filter of that name before
    trying to use the formatter, it will work.
    
    To have the default behavior apply no conversion whatsoever, set
    ``MARKUP_FILTER`` like so::
    
        MARKUP_FILTER = (None, {})
    
    When the ``filter_name`` keyword argument is supplied, the
    ``MARKUP_FILTER`` setting is ignored entirely -- neither a filter
    name nor any keyword arguments will be read from it. This means
    that, by always supplying ``filter_name`` explicitly, it is
    possible to use this formatter without configuring or even
    installing Django.


    Django and template autoescaping
    ================================

    Django's template system defaults to escaping the output of
    template variables, which can interfere with functions intended to
    return HTML. ``MarkupFormatter`` does not in any way tamper with
    Django's autoescaping, so pasing the results of formatting
    directly to a Django template will result in that text being
    escaped.

    If you need to use ``MarkupFormatter`` for items which will be
    passed to a Django template as variables, use the function
    ``django.utils.safestring.mark_safe`` to tell Django's template
    system not to escape that text.
    
    For convenience, a Django template filter is included (in
    ``templatetags/generic_markup.py``) which applies
    ``MarkupFormatter`` to a string and marks the result as not
    requiring autoescaping.
    
    
    Examples
    ========
    
    Using the default behavior, with the filter name and arguments
    taken from the ``MARKUP_FILTER`` setting::
    
        formatter = MarkupFormatter()
        my_string = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\n\nConsectetuer adipiscing elit.'
        my_html = formatter(my_string)
    
    Explicitly naming the filter to use::
    
        my_html = formatter(my_string, filter_name='markdown')
    
    Passing keyword arguments::
    
        my_html = formatter(my_string, filter_name='markdown', safe_mode=True)
    
    Perform no conversion (return the text as-is)::
    
        my_html = formatter(my_string, filter_name=None)
